## The solution

- Weights ``f(Î¸) = (0.315, 0.651, 0.034)`` for ``Î¸ = L, M, H`` respectively.
- ``b = 5.17`` gives weighted elasticity of 0.01 at price of 100â‚¬/MWh.
- The optimal ``K = 83593.0 MW``, which corresponds to a price of ``P = 272.15 â‚¬/MWh``.
  - With CCGT of power ``450 MW``, this corresponds to ``186.0`` power stations needed to supply this optimal capacity at the optimal price.
