## Main results

- Greater market competition (â†‘ Î”) encourages greater reductions in emissions and greater increases in welfare, conditional on the cost of investment in green technologies
- Aggregate pollution decreases with consumer's social responsibility concerns Î´
- Greater consumer social responbility concerns (Î´) increase welfare if and only if competition is strong enough
- Run the Pluto.jl notebook to see how emissions and welfare change with changes in:
  - consumer preferences Î´
  - the size of leading-edge innovations Î³
  - level of competition Î”
  - marginal cost of labor c
  - cost of innovation Îº
  - investment flow I(Î”)
