# Environmental Economics & Climate Policy at [TSE](https://tse-fr.eu)

A Pluto.jl notebook to explore the model of [Aghion et al (2021)](https://scholar.harvard.edu/aghion/publications/environmental-preferences-and-technological-choices-market-competition-clean-or)

## Main results

- Greater market competition (↑ Δ) encourages greater reductions in emissions and greater increases in welfare, conditional on the cost of investment in green technologies
- Aggregate pollution decreases with consumer's social responsibility concerns δ
- Greater consumer social responbility concerns (δ) increase welfare if and only if competition is strong enough
- Run the Pluto.jl notebook to see how emissions and welfare change with changes in:
  - consumer preferences δ
  - the size of leading-edge innovations γ
  - level of competition Δ
  - marginal cost of labor c
  - cost of innovation κ
  - investment flow I(Δ)
